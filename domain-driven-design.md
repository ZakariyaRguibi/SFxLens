# Domain-Driven Design Principles for SFxLens

## Introduction to DDD in SFxLens

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) provides the foundation for SFxLens's architecture, focusing on modeling software around business domains and core concepts. This document outlines how DDD principles are applied throughout the application.

## Core Concepts

### Ubiquitous Language

SFxLens establishes a consistent language across all domains:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Automation | Any programmatic process in Salesforce (Flow, Apex, Workflow, etc.) |
| Dependency | A relationship where one automation relies on another |
| Impact Analysis | Assessment of how changes to one component affect others |
| Execution Path | The sequence of steps an automation follows when triggered |
| Performance Metric | Measurable data about automation execution |

### Bounded Contexts

Each domain in SFxLens has a clearly defined boundary:

1. **Automation Discovery Context**: Everything related to finding and categorizing automations
2. **Dependency Mapping Context**: Everything related to relationships between automations
3. **Performance Analysis Context**: Everything related to execution metrics and optimization
4. **Visualization Context**: Everything related to rendering visual representations
5. **Administration Context**: Everything related to system configuration and management

### Context Maps

Relationships between bounded contexts are explicitly defined:

- **Discovery → Dependency**: Discovered automations feed into dependency analysis
- **Dependency → Performance**: Dependency chains affect performance analysis
- **All → Visualization**: All contexts provide data for visualization
- **Administration → All**: Administration controls settings for all other contexts

## Domain Models

### Entities

Core entities with distinct identities:

- **AutomationComponent**: Base entity for all automation types
- **DependencyRelationship**: Connections between automation components
- **PerformanceRecord**: Execution performance data points
- **UserConfiguration**: User-specific settings and preferences

### Value Objects

Immutable objects that describe characteristics:

- **ExecutionMetrics**: CPU time, SOQL usage, DML operations
- **RelationshipType**: Nature of dependency (calls, references, modifies)
- **AutomationCategory**: Classification of automation purpose
- **VisualizationSettings**: Parameters for visual representation

### Aggregates

Clusters of entities and value objects:

- **AutomationAggregate**: Root is AutomationComponent, includes metadata
- **DependencyNetworkAggregate**: Root is DependencyGraph, includes relationships
- **PerformanceProfileAggregate**: Root is PerformanceProfile, includes metrics
- **VisualizationAggregate**: Root is Visualization, includes layout settings

### Domain Events

Events that domain experts care about:

- **AutomationDiscoveredEvent**: New automation found
- **DependencyDetectedEvent**: New relationship identified
- **PerformanceThresholdExceededEvent**: Performance limit exceeded
- **VisualizationCreatedEvent**: New visualization generated

## Repositories

Each aggregate has a corresponding repository:

- **AutomationRepository**: CRUD operations for automation components
- **DependencyRepository**: Operations for dependency relationships
- **PerformanceRepository**: Operations for performance records
- **VisualizationRepository**: Operations for saved visualizations

## Services

Domain services that don't naturally belong to entities:

- **DependencyAnalysisService**: Analyzes complex dependency networks
- **PerformanceOptimizationService**: Generates optimization recommendations
- **ImpactPredictionService**: Predicts impact of changes
- **MetadataTransformationService**: Transforms raw metadata to domain models

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with Core Domains**: Initially focus on Discovery and Visualization
2. **Evolve Models Iteratively**: Refine models based on user feedback
3. **Maintain Context Boundaries**: Enforce strict separation between contexts
4. **Event-Driven Integration**: Use events for cross-context communication
5. **Domain-First Testing**: Test based on domain requirements before implementation

## Evolution Path

The domain model will evolve through these stages:

1. **Basic Model**: Core automation discovery and simple visualization
2. **Enhanced Relationships**: Add dependency tracking and impact analysis
3. **Performance Insights**: Add performance metrics and optimization
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Add AI-powered recommendations and predictions
5. **Enterprise Integration**: Add integration with DevOps and ALM systems
