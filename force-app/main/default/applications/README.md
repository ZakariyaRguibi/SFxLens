# User Interfaces

This layer defines the main user-facing applications and tabs, providing context-aware interfaces that adapt to user roles and needs through a domain-driven approach.

## Architecture Approach

- **Context-Aware UIs**: Interfaces that adapt based on user role, permissions, and preferences
- **Domain-Oriented Navigation**: Navigation structure aligned with business domains
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed progressively to avoid overwhelming users
- **Experience Continuity**: Consistent interaction patterns across all interfaces
- **Adaptive Design**: Responsive interfaces that work across device types and sizes

## Best Practices

1. **User Context**: Always consider the user's context when designing interfaces
2. **Simplified Workflow**: Minimize clicks for common operations
3. **Consistent Patterns**: Use the same interaction patterns across interfaces
4. **Performance First**: Optimize UIs for responsiveness
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure all interfaces are fully accessible
