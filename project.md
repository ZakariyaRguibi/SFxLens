### **Project Overview: Salesforce Automation Explorer**  

**Description:**  
Salesforce organizations often accumulate complex layers of automation, including Flows, Apex Triggers, Workflow Rules, and Process Builder processes. Understanding how these automations interact with objects, fields, and business logic can be challenging.  

This application is designed as a **Salesforce-native tool** to fetch, visualize, and analyze all automation in an org. It provides a **schema builder-like experience** but specifically for automation, offering an intuitive graphical representation of automation dependencies and execution paths.

### **Key Features**  

1. **Automation Discovery & Categorization**  
   - Scans and lists all automation by object (Flows, Apex Triggers, Workflow Rules, etc.).  
   - Groups automation by standard/custom objects for quick reference.  
   - Displays relationships between automations, such as which Flows call subflows or interact with Apex.  

2. **Graphical Visualization**  
   - **Schema Builder for Automation:** A drag-and-drop interface showing automation dependencies.  
   - Interactive flowcharts linking triggers, flows, and Apex classes.  
   - Highlights potential conflicts or redundant automations.  

3. **Impact Analysis & Dependency Tracking**  
   - Identifies which automations affect a given object or field.  
   - Shows execution order of automations.  
   - Tracks Apex classes referenced in automation and their dependencies.  

4. **Error & Log Analysis**  
   - Centralized view of automation-related errors and logs.  
   - Filters logs by object, automation type, and timeframe.  
   - Provides recommendations for resolving common errors.  

5. **Performance Insights**  
   - Flags inefficient automations that could slow down record operations.  
   - Identifies recursive automation loops.  
   - Reports automation execution times and DML/SOQL limits.

### **Use Cases**  

- **Developers & Architects:** Understand existing automation before making changes.  
- **Admins:** Identify redundant automations and optimize business logic.  
- **Business Analysts:** Gain insights into automation logic without needing deep technical knowledge.  
- **Auditors & Security Teams:** Assess automation risks and governance compliance.  

---

### **Future Enhancements**  

- **AI-powered recommendations** for automation optimization.  
- **Version history tracking** for automations.  
- **User permission mapping** to see who can modify automation.  
- **Integration with DevOps tools** for deployment impact analysis.
